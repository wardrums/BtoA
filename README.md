# BtoA
Blender to Arnold


##Install Instructions

  1. Install Arnold from https://www.solidangle.com/arnold/download i used MtoA, but any should work.
  2. Run 2to3 on the arnold python directory. copy directory into blenders module path
  3a. add the directory to (libai.dll, libai.so, libai.dylib) to your LD_LIB_PATH or;
  3b. edit arnold_common.py in the arnold directory to point to the location of libai.
  4. install BtoA

This is very unstable and will not work most of the time. the arnold version it is compatable with is 3-4 years old.
still learning Arnold, so updates will come.
